# Skyline-Drawing

This was my first algoritmical application of C in a purpose built project in my first year of university.

The objective was to help an architect draw the skyline of a city given the coordinates of the buildings.

There is here some bad practices in this exercise that I've learnt from, especially regarding the naming of variables.
